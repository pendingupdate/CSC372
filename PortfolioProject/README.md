# CSC372: Computer Programming II

## Module 8: Portfolio Project - Option #1: Lessons Learned and Final Program

** Milestones **

Milestone 1 (due at the end of Week 4): Java source code (with corrections as required) for programs created in Modules 1-3.

Milestone 2 (due at the end of Week 7): Java source code (with corrections as required) for programs created in Modules 5-6.

** Final Portfolio Project **

In Week 8, the components you must complete for your Portfolio Project are the Lessons Learned Reflection and the Final Program. Carefully review the requirements below.

** Lessons Learned Reflection **

Write a summary outlining the lessons you have learned in this programming course. Reflect on how these lessons can be applied to effective coding.

This essay portion of your Portfolio must:

- Be 2-3 pages in length (not including the required title and references pages)
- Be formatted according to APA guidelines in the CSU Global Writing CenterLinks to an external site.
- Include at least three outside references from the course readings, formatted according to APA requirements.

** Final Program **

Write a Java program that incorporates a loop that prompts the user for student data. Student data are private fields in a student class including:

- String name
- String address
- double GPA

Each student object is stored in a linked list.

After the user completes the data entry, output the contents of the linked list in ascending sorted order by name to a regular text file that can be opened and viewed using a simple plain-text editor such as Notepad.

Validate numeric data for Grade Point Average (GPA).

Compile your Lessons Learned Reflection, source code, screenshots of the application executing, and results into a single document.

Format your document in MS Word, according to APA guidelines in the [CSU Global Writing Center](http://csuglobal.libguides.com/apacitations), particularly in developing your Lessons Learned Reflection. Support your reflection with a minimum of three references, as noted above. Include both a cover page and a reference page with your Portfolio Project.

Submit your completed Portfolio Project by the end of Week 8.
