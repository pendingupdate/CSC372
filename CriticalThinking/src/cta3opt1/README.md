# CSC372: Computer Programming II

## Module 3 - Option 1: Creating a User Interface I

Create a user interface that has a top bar that includes a menu. The menu should have four items.

* When the user selects the first menu option, then the date and time should be printed in a text box.
* When the user selects the second menu option, then the text box contents should be written to a text file named "log.txt."
* When the user selects the third menu item then the frame background color changes to random color hue of the color green. The menu option should display the initial random hue each time selected for a single execution of the program. See <https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.aspLinks> to an external site.
* When the user selects the fourth menu option then the program exits.

Students must use appropriate version control for all programmatic assignments created. GIT repositories should be established and screen captures of repositories submitted with each assignment.
