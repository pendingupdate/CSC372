# CSC372: Computer Programming II

## Module 2 - Critical Thinking Assignment - Option 2: Creating a GUI Application

Create a simple GUI application that will obtain the birth date from a user. The program must then calculate and display the age of the user within a JPanel when the user selects a button. The GUI should display the value presented.

Ensure that your application includes the following components:

- JPanel
- JButton
- ActionListener

Submit screenshots of your program's execution and output. Include all appropriate source code in a zip file.

Students must use appropriate version control for all programmatic assignments created. GIT repositories should be established and screen captures of repositories submitted with each assignment.
